# Qt VKID Table Widget
A widget for Qt that displays a table of virtual key IDs (VKIDs), complete with a search bar, and clipboard support for copying VKIDs from the table. This widget is based on a layout, meaning it is actually a subclass of a Qt layout with predefined elements contained within. This repository is meant to be used as a submodule in other repositories, and when doing so, the "include" branch should be used for convenience.
